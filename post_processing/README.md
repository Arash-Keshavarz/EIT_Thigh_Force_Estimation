## Overview

This section focuses on extensive postprocessing of data acquired from the EIT and isoforce devices.

The primary aim is to achieve optimal temporal alignment between the EIT and isoforce data using their timestamps.

To ensure accurate alignment, the National Instruments chip is used to record timestamps from the isoforce device, enabling precise synchronization between the two data sources.

Additionally, this script automates the postprocessing workflow, preparing the data for machine learning (ML) analysis.
