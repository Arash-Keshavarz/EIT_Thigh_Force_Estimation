# EIT_Thigh_Force_Measurement

This repository contains data and code for an experimental study measuring Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) data to assess thigh strength and force levels. The goal is to process and analyze the collected data for solving a regression and classification problem in the force range of 20â€“80 Nm across different participants.


## Overview

This study leverages EIT technology(Sciospec Device) to explore the relationship between muscle force and EIT data. Measurements are conducted with a focus on participant anonymity, systematic protocol, and thorough data collection.
